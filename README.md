Gears of Hell
========
Gears of Hell is/was a randomizer weapons/monsters mod that I worked when I was younger together with Lolo_is_Cool/Thiny93 as a tribute to my favorite mod "Aeons of Death". 
For today standards, and even back in the day, this mod is pretty convoluted and full of resource rips. For the last year of so, I've been trying to flatten it out and make it a little more cohesive (unsucessfully). 
Still, I have a lot of love for this mod because it was kinda of my gateway to coding, which is very important to me now as I'm coding in Python and Matlab IRL for my academic career. So, I wanted to give this mod his last run and polish a little bit before move on to a new Doom project that I have for 2021.
