Misc. Author Info       : Live and Reload (a really old jokewad) and BRArmory (A early version of this wad)
Description             : Gears of Hell is/was a randomizer weapons/monsters mod that I worked when I was younger together with Lolo_is_Cool/Thiny93 as a tribute to my favorite mod "Aeons of Death". 
For today standards, and even back in the day, this mod is pretty convoluted and full of resource rips. For the last year of so, I've been trying to flatten it out and make it a little more cohesive (unsucessfully). 
Still, I have a lot of love for this mod because it was kinda of my gateway to coding, which is very important to me now as I'm coding in Python and Matlab IRL for my academic career. So, I wanted to give this mod his last run and polish a little bit before move on to a new Doom project that I have for 2021.

As I said, this mod is full of resources that I may have not properly credited or contacted the authors when I was younger.
If you see anything here that is yours and it is not properly credited, or you don't want it to be used here, contact me so I can remove it.

Also, there is a "pistol start" option in the menu now. You might turn it off or on depending of your intentions.
